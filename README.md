# Top Down Racing Game

Thanks for taking interest in my game, hopefully you enjoy it as I enjoyed making it

This game is a traditional top-down racing game which I created in order to get expirience with this genre of games.

# Features
## Controls
- Player 1 uses the arrow keys
- Player 2 uses WASD (I am so sorry about the opposing sides of the screen and such, it could be worse. You'll see if you play 2 player)
- Enter pauses the race and selects options from menus

## Mechanics
- Each race has 3 laps by default, but more laps can be added from the settings menu
- Many more settings which can be changed at the main menu
- 4 Unique skins
- 2 WHOLE RACES (I know, contain your excitement)
- Lap Timer
